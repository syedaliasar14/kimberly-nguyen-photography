      question: "How far in advance should we book you for our wedding?",
      answer: "Typically, couples book me about 6-8 months before their wedding date. I encourage you to reach out as soon as possible about my availability, even if youâ€™re planning on a shorter time frame.",
    },
    {
      question: "Do you travel for weddings?",
      answer: "Yes! I have traveled all over New England and beyond. For locations that are over an hour driving distance from Hartford County, I apply a travel fee. When submitting your inquiry, please include the location if possible so I can include travel estimate costs.",
    },
    {
      question: "How long will it take to see our photos?",
      answer: "Typically, you'll be able to view your photos online about 6-8 weeks after your wedding. Within this time, you can also expect to receive a link to high-resolution image files, so you can share the photos with your loved ones. You also have the option of ordering prints straight from that site. I also like to send sneak peeks within a week after the wedding so you can have a taste of what's to come!",
    },
    {
      question: "Do you work with assistants or other photographers?",
      answer: "I have a trusted group of photographers and videographers that I rely on and reach out to when I need to form a bigger team for an event.",
    },
    {
      question: "Will you edit all our photos?",
      answer: "Definitely. All final images will be edited for color, saturation, exposure, and sharpness to ensure they look beautiful to the style you see in my work.",
    },
    {
      question: "Do you offer retouching on the images?",
      answer: "At this time I do not offer retouching on my images. Each image delivered to you is hand-picked and professionally edited keeping factors such as color correction, visual ambiance, and cropping in mind. I do not offer altering of my Clients' general appearance that includes: bags under eyes, body size or shape, wrinkles, hair color, height, skin tone, etc. If requested, I will refer you to trusted retouching experts I have worked with. Their fees/costs are up to their own business discretion.",
