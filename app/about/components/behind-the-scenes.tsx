                I believe the best wedding photography happens when couples feel completely 
                comfortable and natural. That's why I spend time getting to know you before 
                your wedding dayâ€”understanding your story, your vision, and what matters most to you.
              </p>
              <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
                On your wedding day, I blend into the background, documenting moments as they 
                happen while providing gentle guidance when needed. My goal is for you to forget 
                I'm there, so you can be fully present with each other and your loved ones.
              </p>
              <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
                After your wedding, I carefully curate and edit your images, ensuring each photo 
                reflects the beauty and emotion of your day with my signature bright, clean aesthetic.
