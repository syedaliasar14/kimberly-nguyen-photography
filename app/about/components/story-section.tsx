            Photography found me through love—first, my love for capturing fleeting moments, 
            and later, through witnessing the profound love between couples on their wedding days.
          </p>
          
          <p className="mb-8">
            What started as a passion for documenting life's beautiful moments grew into a 
            calling to serve couples during one of the most significant days of their lives. 
            I believe that wedding photography is so much more than just taking pictures—it's 
            about preserving the emotions, the connections, and the story that unfolds when 
            two people choose to commit their lives to each other.

            My approach is rooted in authenticity. I'm not interested in forced poses or 
            artificial moments. Instead, I focus on the real, unguarded instances—the way 
            you look at each other when you think no one is watching, the laughter shared 
            with family, the quiet tears of joy. These are the moments that tell your true story.
          </p>
          
          <p className="mb-8">
            When I'm not behind the camera, you can find me exploring local coffee shops, 
            spending time in nature, or traveling to new places that inspire my creativity. 
            I bring this sense of adventure and wonder to every wedding I photograph, always 
            looking for the unique beauty in each celebration.
